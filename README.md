Monesave Token (MONC) – Introducing a Crypto Token for Smart payment Rings.

In a fast-paced world, it is pointless walking around with wallets, cash or cards. When you can securely, pay contactless with your Smart Ring.
Wallets and cards attract Thieves! And phone batteries die, but Rings are forever…Each Ring in our collection is not just piece of jewellery or another revolutionary fintech. Its a combination of both, infused with your personality. Order your Ring now.
MONC Token is only Crypto allowed on the Monesave App for Payments. Monesave Token (MONC) is a next-generation utility token designed to bridge the gap between digital assets and real-world spending. 
Integrated within the Monesave ecosystem, MONC empowers users with seamless, contactless payments through Payment Rings at shops, restaurants, and anywhere that accepts contactless transactions across the world. 
Built on blockchain technology and governed by a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), MONC is redefining financial accessibility, savings, and decentralized decision-making.
